# Business Card

This is a custom-built digital business card developed from scratch using **HTML** and **CSS**. While the project idea was inspired by Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Path, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice building responsive web components and personal branding elements.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

This project showcases a functional digital business card that includes:

- A profile picture and name
- Contact information such as email and phone number
- Links to professional profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub)
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The HTML structure defines the layout of the business card, including sections for the profile image, contact details, and social links.
- CSS is used to style the card, including layout, colors, and typography, ensuring a clean and professional appearance.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Scrimba, the following customizations were implemented:

- Designed and styled the layout from scratch using CSS

- Structured the HTML for semantic clarity and accessibility

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Add hover effects on social links
- Implement dark mode with CSS variables
- Enhance layout for tablet/desktop view
